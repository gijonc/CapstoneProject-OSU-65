	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\Getting all the basic hardware components and devices, start working on hardware setup including board hoop-up and sample code testing. Also set up a meeting with our clients to talk about plans and changes of the project progress.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We held the first group meeting of the term and we decided to purchase our own board if the hardware not arriving yet.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\Delayed on getting the necessary hardware components and we couldn't start the implementation.\\
