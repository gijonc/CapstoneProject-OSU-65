	\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\As the first week after break, I plan to have a meeting with the entire group as well as our clients, we will plan to give a short report to them and we plan to move on with our project\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\I briefly took a look at the new schedule of the spring term and start making plan based on our current situation.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We still found hard to retrieve two sets of data from the two different IMUs, we considered our old GUI program is NOT clearly enough to for our demonstration purpose, we planned to develop a new GUI program.\\

		\textbf{Week 2 (Apr. 10 {\textasciitilde{}} 14, 2017)}
	\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\By the coming week, we plan to update and fix our poster as the second draft. We also plan to group up to work on the project together, specifically will focus on the design of the UI of the demonstration system.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We held our first meeting since the spring break and we planned out our schedule for the rest of the term.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We found hard to fix the poster since everything is on a very level terminology, and since we have not done the statical analysis for our final testing result, we won't be able to put a specific result onto the poster.\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\We plan to fix our poster for the final draft and have it send to our client for verification. We also plan to meet up again to continue woking on the project together.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We got some feedback from the TA in terms of how to fix and update for our poster. We finally found a Python library called VPython that is easy to implement, and it provides ideal graphical interface (3D model animation) for our project virtual demonstration, we have also figured out the hardware configuration in terms of getting data from two IMUs as different addresses.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We could not illustrate the best graphical display model for showing off to the audience in the expo, we want it to be straight forward and understandable, but also be able to demonstrate our result and outcome of the complex system.\\

		\\We will try to finish up everything for the project and have a well plan for the demonstration in the expo. We had grouped up again and made some progress on the project.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We fixed the refined our poster, we submitted the final draft of poster to our client, everything looks good to them.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We could not show our result to our client as they expect, we are still trying to improve the accuracy and stability of our output, and we will figure out the best way to show off the detail of the alignment.\\

		\\We will try to finish up putting the Arduino program with the demonstration UI program together and test for expo demonstration, we will make a detailed plan for the demonstration in the expo, also plan to show our result to our client see if we can improve based on what we have.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We finally submitted our poster for printing. We roughly finished all implementation on the software part of the project, and we updated our github repo with the latest version of our project, and we also updated the README file in terms of our project description.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We could not improve the accuracy for the final output result, we may need to ask for some suggestions from our client, we also have not not yet test for the performance of the GUI, we may need to spend some time to debug.\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\The Friday of coming week will be the engineering EXPO day, so we plan to finalize our project for the expo demonstration, and we also plan to build our demonstration system.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We have finalized our GUI and we found out that our dynamic alignment process makes a not bad result.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We found out a our result is not accurate enough especially and we believe that is because of something goes wrong with yaw calculation or implementation, but we could not determine if the problem comes from the hardware or our algorithm.\\

		\textbf{Week 7 (May. 15 {\textasciitilde{}} 19, 2017)}
	\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\We plan to implement our physical test on our current system and we also plan to set up a meeting with our client to report our result.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We finally held our EXPO last week, although we could not complete our project in hundred percent, we did demonstrated our project and we did attracted a number of visitors to our expo. And even though our project seems to be hard to understand for general audience, some people were still quite interested in knowing about our project.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We could not demonstrate our system with the static alignment algorithm since something goes wrong within the algorithm. Another problem I encountered was that I could not explain my project clearly to the audiences, I could not explain well to those who do not have any background knowledge about our project.\\

	\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\We plan to do our final physical test to verify our result and also plan to set up a meeting with our client to report our final progress.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We discussed and designed for the physical test.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We did not set up the meeting with our client yet since we have not finished the physical test.\\

		\item \textbf{If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?}
		\\You should start working on the project as soon as possible discussed with the client mote often.\\

		\item \textbf{What is the biggest skill you've learned?}
		\\The biggest skill I learned is how to get into a field that I am unfamiliar with before or even not having any experience, my project is kind of like that, which I did not know anything about my project or any background knowledge before I really worked on it, however, throughout this project, I learned how to get start with a project like this.\\

		\item \textbf{What skills do you see yourself using in the future?}
		\\I think I will use the skill of dealing with projects involve in both hardware and software.\\

		\item \textbf{What did you like about the project, and what did you not?}
		\\I like that my project was not purely dealing with software or programming, but involve much with hardware, physics and mathematics; One thing I do not like about my project is that we did not have much resources or equipments to test with, we got only some conceptual ideas and thoughts and we did not have the chance to work with the real HUD (equipment).\\

		\item \textbf{What did you learn from your teammates?}
		\\From Drew, I learned that we should not rely on other external examples or existed libraries too much during implementing our project, we should design our own one based on other resources.\\

		\item \textbf{If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?}
		\\ I probably will not be 100\% satisfied with the current work done since we did not have a result as expected, however I can understand with that since we had limited time, knowledge and resources for our project implementation.\\

		\item \textbf{If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?}
		\\First we can test with varied models of IMUs and select the one that has the best performance and is the easiest to deal with, then we will try to use more IMUs to work together for achieving better performance, and the most important thing that I consider need to be worked on is to design a complete test procedures for in order to precisely test the output of the system.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\I was able to push a working version of our alignment solution. Submitted my release form for expo.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\When taking the offset using quaternions I found that the result was inaccurate while the quaternion was converging as a result of the filter algorithm. I tried to remove samples taken during the convergence period by analyzing the change of values over time. More work needs to be done to improve this process. Another problem I faced had to do with the error of individual samples. Even when the device was stationary, I noticed values spiking at times. I attempted to remove these samples by using a hard coded threshold that was determined heuristically. I'm not sure what the best approach would be at this current time.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\We have been having problems with the magnetometer data and poor readings. I'm not sure if I miss configured the device or am not performing sufficient calibration. Since expo is next week, we will explore a 6-axis filter instead of the 9-axis filter.\\

		\\I finished my part of the midterm progress report. We met up to discuss our project to ensure we were all on the same page for expo. We built a simple demonstration system that could be manipulated during expo to help explain our project. EXPO!\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\My audio input is not working so I had to meet up with Roger and use his laptop to record my presentation. Our system has yet to undergo the physical tests that are required before sending our results to RC. Since our system has yet to be tested, I realized late that our solution was not correctly checking for static offset. In order to make our solution work, we would have to move the HUD sensor from the IRU to the HUD and then take the difference. Our error was a result of testing our system on a with an aligned axis. What we were really detection was simple the sensor bias. Our false interpretation was reaffirmed because we were successfully taking the dynamic offset.\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plans for the coming week}
		\\I am planning on meeting with our group and getting in contact with our client. I'm also planning on working on our final documents.\\

		\item \textbf{Progress since last week}
		\\Started working on our final documents.\\

		\item \textbf{Any problems I encountered}
		\\We were not able to meet this week so testing the system and contacting our client delayed.\\

		\item \textbf{If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?}
		\\First of all, I would tell myself to setup version control early and make use of the skills learned in my software development classes to promote collaboration and a sense of direction while building momentum as milestones were reached. Next, I would tell myself to utilize the availability of our clients by asking more questions when referencing the technical challenges of our project. Lastly, I would stress testing early; both physically and programmatically.\\

		\item \textbf{What is the biggest skill you've learned?}
		\\ I think biggest skill I have learned would have to be the ability to work with sensors such as an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. I choose this because there was a lot involved. First, I had to learn how to configure devices by reading through the devices register mapping documentation. Next, I had to learn how to calibrate the devices by taking initial readings during setup, comparing them against factory defaults and storing the results in the appropriate registers or using that information to modify future readings. I also had to learn how communication between devices worked and why and how some devices should be configure as slaves or masters.\\

		\item \textbf{What skills do you see yourself using in the future?}
		\\Considering the shift towards the Internet of things, I can see myself working with multiple devices while facilitating the necessary communication for those devices in future work or even hobby projects.\\

		\item \textbf{What did you like about the project, and what did you not?}
		\\I liked that I was given an opportunity to work in an area I was not familiar with. I did not like how much work was required to catch up in understanding of particular topics when I would have rather been making significant progress towards a solution.\\

		\item \textbf{What did you learn from your teammates?}
		\\I learned additional interpersonal skills and strategies to overcome poor first impressions. My team also helped me to learn skills relating to latex and vpython.\\

		\item \textbf{If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?}
		\\ I would have liked to see a better solution but I believe the documented requirements have been met.\\

		\item \textbf{If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?}
		\\Memory considerations when analyzing sensor output. Improve calibration of sensors then test against documented hardware error tolerance specifications. Magnetometer considerations. Physical tests against filtered quaternion output and the resulting offset with static values. Look into physically testing dynamic values. Research methods to handle drift such as resetting to a known reference then finding ways to physically test against under expected conditions.\\
