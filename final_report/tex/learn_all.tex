\section{What did we learn from all this?}
	\subsection{Jiongcheng Luo}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{What technical information did you learn?}
			\\ Throughout this course, a new technology I learned is Latex formatting. Throughout the project, I learned a lot about manufacturing an aircraft, especially its Head-up display system and Inertial Measurement Unit. I learned how an IMUs works and how we could apply it into a useful product. Specifically, from the perspective of software, I learned how to program Arduino and using VPython library.\\

			\item \textbf{What non-technical information did you learn?}
			\\I learned how to collaborate with a team from everyone did not know each other to everyone made a project together, specifically are the skills of communication, cooperation with co-workers. In addition, we had change to contact with a real company client, I learned a lot how a real industry deal with new technologies.  Throughout working on the project, I learned how to compare and choose the tools or technologies to be used for our project.\\

			\item \textbf{What have you learned about project work?}
			\\I learned that before doing a project, a team should have well discussion and make sure everyone understands what this project is doing. After that, a detailed, comprehensive plan needs to be made, during design procedures, all documents need to keep track of any changes and new ideas. During software development, using agile methodology is preferred, so that every part of the software can be modified easily.\\

			\item \textbf{What have you learned about project management?}
			\\A project first should be designed comprehensively including all details, graphs, diagrams, examples, documents etc. And during the implementation, itâ€™s necessary to use version control for all software programs especially for a program that with complicated structure. Everyone can work on a different version for implementing different purpose or portion of the project, a completed version should a merge of all completed parts by different version and the merge needs to be agreed by all team members.\\

			\item \textbf{What have you learned about working in teams?}
			\\I learned that everyone in a team must has unique background knowledge, interests and everyone has different focus field, therefore, in order to get our project done successfully, we need to know each other well, including the lack and expertise of everyone, so that everyone can work on what they good at and everyone can complement for each other.\\

			\item \textbf{If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?}
			\\First, I would get started working on the project earlier, we had spent too much time on the design procedures and researching, then we found that we did not have enough time to accomplish the plans since more problems came up with we moving forward. Second, I would use version control system to keep track of our program, since we had met a problem that we did not save the previous version and we overwrote it, and as a result, we lose the version that was working before, so that we had to redo it all over again. Third, I would meet with our clients more often in regards to technical discussion, we had a lot of issues and problems that we did not know how to solve at all, and we had spent too much time in researching and attempting, that leads to that we could not complete some parts of the project at the end. Fourth, I would try using more IMUs for testing purpose, even though our result showed that working, it did not meet our initial expectation, more IMUs would more accurate.\\
